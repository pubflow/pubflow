Key Questions About This License
1. What is the license of the work I do? Do you own my code or projects?
No, we do not own your code or projects. Here's what you need to know:

Your Work Remains Yours: Any work you create using our software, including code, projects, or content generated by our API, remains entirely your own. You retain full copyright and ownership of your creations.
Freedom to Use: You are free to use, modify, and distribute your work as you see fit, under any license you choose.
No Claim on Your Work: The AGPL-3 license of our software does not extend to the output produced by using our software. We make no claim of ownership or copyright on your work.

2. How does this license affect me as a user?
For most users, this license has minimal impact:

Normal Usage: If you're using Pubflow for personal or internal use within your organization, the AGPL-3 license does not affect you. You can use the software freely without any obligations.
Distribution or Hosting: The license only comes into play if you want to distribute Pubflow or host it as a service to others. In these cases, you must make the source code (including any modifications) available under the same AGPL-3 license.

3. What is AGPL-3 and why did we choose it?
The GNU Affero General Public License version 3 (AGPL-3) is a copyleft license designed to ensure that the software remains open source, even when used to provide services over a network.
We chose AGPL-3 for the following reasons:

Protect Openness: It prevents companies from creating closed-source cloud wrappers around our open-source project without contributing back.
Encourage Contributions: It fosters a collaborative environment where improvements are shared with the community.
Ensure Fairness: It guarantees that the software and any modifications remain open and accessible to all users.
Balance Innovation and Openness: It creates an ecosystem that supports both innovation and the principles of open-source software.
